# On the spectral efficiency of full-duplex small cell wireless systems

This repo contains the code for the algorithms presented in the following scientific paper:

Dan Nguyen, Le-Nam Tran, Pekka Pirinen, and Matti Latva-aho, "On the Spectral Efficiency of Full-Duplex Small Cell Wireless Systems, IEEE Trans. Wireless Commun., vol. 13, no. 9, pp. 4896-4910, Sep. 2014.

## Instructions
The code makes use of [Yalmip](https://yalmip.github.io/) as a parser, [SDPT3](https://github.com/sqlp/sdpt3) and [MOSEK](https://www.mosek.com/) as the internal convex conic solver for Algorithms 1 and 2, respectively.

We also publish the code at [CodeOcean](https://codeocean.com/capsule/9973383/tree/v1) where you can run them online without installing the required packages.
